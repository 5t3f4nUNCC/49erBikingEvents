            <p class="text-center">
                This website aims to provide a platform for the avid mountain bikers in the Charlotte area to coordinate rides of all kinds.<br>
                <br>
                We provide a list of events that local riders have created for heading to different types of trails. All levels or rides are present and no one will have to ride alone again.<br>
                <br>
                Events are easily created by users where they are shown on our public list of events. From there, users can view, save, and post their attendance plans for any ride.
                <br><br>
                See How many people are going, when and where the ride is taking place, what type of ride it is, and basic information on the ride all on our events page.

                There are three basic types of rides:
            </p>
            <h3>Road:</h3>
            <p class="text-left">
                The least technical of the three, these rides stick to roads and greenways.<br>
                Any bike can be used and this is the most friendly to new bikers.<br>
                No additional gear is recommended besides a helmet and some water.
            </p>
            <h3>Trail:</h3>
            <p class="text-left">
                Moderately technical, trail rides make use of rocks, roots, wooded hills, and man made structures to provide a fun and challenging ride. Trail rides are often a good combination of up and down hill sections.<br>
                Any bike can be used although a smoother ride is provided through the addition of front and rear shocks.<br>
                No additional gear is recommended besides a helmet and some water. Because trail rides are often bumpy, a CAMELBAK may prove helpful over a conventional water bottle.
            </p>
            <h3>Downhill:</h3>
            <p class="text-left">
                The most technical of the three, downhill trails are a step up from standard mb trails. Downhill trails feature steep, rough terrain that present a variety of obstacles including jumps, drops, and rock gardens.<br>
                We highly recommend that a full suspension or specialized downhill mountain bike is used for downhill trails.<br>
                A full face helmet, goggles, and knee, elbow, and neck padding are highly recommended to prevent injury.
            </p>

                Four types of mountain bikes:
            </p>
            <h3>Rigid:</h3>
            <p class="text-left">
                These bikes are essentially road bikes with wider tires put on them. They have no shocks (rigid) but are still favored by some because all your pedaling goes straight into the gear system instead of being absorbed by shocks.
                <br><br>
                Essentially you can get more power out of a rigid bike.
            </p>
            <h3>Hard Tail/Cross Country:</h3>
            <p class="text-left">
                These are very common amongst beginners. Hard tails provide a softer ride through their font suspension. Softer rides take less out of your arms and legs and allow for longer rides. Hard tails don't have rear suspension (thus hard tail), in general making it a cheaper option than other mountain bikes. This lack of rear suspension also allows more of your pedaling to go into the gear system, similar to but less so than a rigid bike.
                <br><br>
                Overall, a good compromise of softness, power, and cost for any rider.
            </p>
            <h3>Full Suspension/All Mountain/Enduro:</h3>
            <p class="text-left">
                Full suspension bikes provide the softest rides as they have front and rear wheel suspension. These bikes are often designed with climbing or descending in mind and can be used on a large variety of trails. Because they have front and rear suspension, they take the most out of your pedaling power.
                <br><br>
                Full suspension bikes are for those that want a really smooth ride or the ability to take on larger obstacles without damaging your bike or yourself.
            </p>
            <h3>Downhill:</h3>
            <p class="text-left">
                A specialization of full suspension bikes, downhill bikes are built with stronger frames and shocks that are stiffer and have larger amounts of travel to help with the large jumps, drops, and obstacles that are present on a downhill trail. Downhill bikes also feature higher end disk brakes and other components to help slow down the bike on the steep mountain side and keep it functioning under the high stresses present on the trail.
                <br><br>
                Downhill bikes are a lot heavier than other bikes and are very expensive. These are usually only used on the mountain side.
